      <h1> To address mental health issues in immigrant communities, we must understand them first.</h1><br>

      <div>
      <h2>Who are immigrants?</h2>
        
      <p>An immigrant is anyone living in a country other than the one they are born in. They make up a significant portion of Canada's population but are often misunderstood and even marginalized in society. In Canada, immigrants make up 21.5% of the population, yet our concerns, issues, and struggles with mental health often go unadressed and ignored. Although we have recently been destigmatizing mental illnesses in broader society, this isn't the case in many immigrant communities, who often misunderstand mental health or are unable to get treatment due to socioeconomic barriers.</p>

      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p>Immigration is a uniquely stressful process. Although most immigrants arrive healthy, their mental health generally worsens over time due to various stressors that increase suicidal ideation and risk of mental illnes. Distress caused by social marginalization, intergenerational conflicts and economic disenfranchisement can exacerbate or cause psychological disorders. Unfortunately, mental health is often disregarded in immigrant communities due to a lack of resources and the stigma associated with mental illnesses. This needs to stop.</p>

    <h3>Discrimination</h3>
    <p>Often, Immigrants experience discrimination in their work places, neighborhoods, service agencies and in schools. The basis of this discrimination is often placed on their immigration status, skin color, english language skills, income and education levels, and other characteristics that are out of their control. Further, immigrants are often negatively stereotyped as lazy opportunists who "steal jobs" from native citizens and take advantage of their host country's social safety nets. These stereotypes prevent immigrants from fully integrating into their communities and have negative consequences for their mental health.

      <h3>Ignorance</h3>
      <p>Many immigrants do not know about mental health and when they do, it is often considered unimportant or somethingnegative to acknowledge. Many immigrants experience barriers that can affect their utilization of mental health services. Poverty, lack of reception by mainstream society, limited networks of social support and opportunities, policies that restrict access to health care and a lack of knowledge about mental health services make immigrants less likely to pursue mental health services or even learn about it at all.</p>

          <h3>Understand</h3>
          <p>The mental health of your children, parents and larger community is important. Struggling with mental health is not a flaw in a person's character. Whether a person's mental illness is hereditary, caused by environmental factors, or brought on by stressful situations in life, the bottom line is, one is not a bad person for suffering from these illnesses. Understanding this is the first step to supporting people in your community who may be struggling.</p>

            <h3>Know The Signs</h3>
            <p>It's important to stay alert to common signs of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Being able to recognize when a person is struggling might be the difference in life or death.</p>
            <ul class = 'list'>
              <li><span>- Talking about suicide</span> â€” for example, making statements such as "I'm going to kill myself," "I wish I were dead," or "I wish I hadn't been born"</li>
              <li><span>- Developing personality changes</span> or being severely anxious or agitated.</li>
              <li><span>- Saying goodbye</span> to people as if they won't be seen again</li>
              <li><span>- Constant mood swings</span>, such as having manic episodes one day and feeling deeply discouraged the next</li>
              <li><span>- Withdrawing from social contact</span> and constantly wanting to be left alone</li>
              <li><span>- Believing the worst will happen and overgeneralizing</span> (making overall assumptions based on a single event)</li>

          <h3>Provide Support</h3>
          <p>Although there are limitations to our abilities as normal people, there are things we can do to support people in out community who are struggling:</p>
          <p id = "suggest">Be willing to listen when your loved ones open up to you. It's important to actively and patienty listen - even if its something you don't want to hear.  It can be difficult for a person struggling with a mental illness to talk about their experiences, when they do feel comfortable sharing their feelings with you, cherish it, and hold your criticisms. </p>

As an immigrant, I was motivated to create this project because I have seen the attitudes towards mental health, and the lack of support for people who are struggling, in my community. The purpose of this project is to raise awareness of the struggles immigrants face when it comes to mental health and the ways individuals can support people who may suffer from mental illnesses.
